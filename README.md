GUI-based Python script to perform various tasks such as:
- playing local music files in foobar2000
- accessing a locally stored database (with support for AES-256 encrypted text files)
- downloading from Google Play Music using the unofficial gmusicapi (<3)
- and more...

The latest iteration of a long line of hacky python programs that started when I myself started learning programming.
